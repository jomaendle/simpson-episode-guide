# Simpson Episode Guide

This is a demo application which uses a pre-generated XML file to display a list of episodes from the Simpsons. <br> <br>
To run the application, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). <br>
Before you can start the application, execute `npm install` in the root directory of the project to install all dependencies. <br> <br>
After that, you can start the application by executing `ng serve`. The application will be available at `http://localhost:4200/`. <br>


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
