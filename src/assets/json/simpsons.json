Lisa \"frees\" Bart from the jug using a croquet mallet. Lisa and Maggie then hide, allowing Bart, stumbling in a daze amongst pieces of the precious broken jug lying on the floor, to take the blame.",

This included the key and supporting characters, the jokes, the celebrity appearances, the writers, the mocking of everyday things, and much more, a great one-off documentary with plenty of clips, information and opinion to keep you interested. With contributions from creator Matt Groening, Ricky Gervais, Nick Park, Stephen Hawking, Phill Jupitus, Helen Fielding and Johnny Vegas.",

      "Overview": "The family goes to the library's used book sale; where Homer obtains a copy of Duff's Book of World Records.  When he's gone through all the records, he decides to set one of his own.  Duff tells him that all the personal records have been set.  He needs to help set a group record.  The town tries to set a record for the world's tallest human pyramid; but when they fail, they inadvertently set the record as the world's fattest town, which they celebrate.  Only Marge has a problem with this.  She goes to the Motherloving Sugar Company to lodge her complaint.  The owner Garth Motherloving is less than cooperative, so Marge files a class action lawsuit.  Professor Frink blows the whistle on \"big sugar\" and the court rules in Marge's favor and then bans all sugar from Springfield forever.  All the town's sugar products are burned and Apu's store shelves are empty.  Apu brings Homer into a group determined to smuggle sugar back into Springfield.  Homer and Bart join with Apu, Mr. Burns, Count Fudgula and Garth Mothelovering in a scheme to smuggle in sugar from the island of San Glucose.  They make it into Springfield Harbor, but are intercepted by the police.  Evading Wiggum and Co., Homer finds himself faced with the decision to either \"Dump Cargo\" to make Marge happy or \"Obey Bad Guy\" and bring sugar to Springfield.  He chooses the former, but Judge Snyder realizes that he's overstepped his authority and makes sugar legal once again.",

      "Overview": "Our story begins a la \"Forrest Gump\", with Homer sitting on a park bench waiting for the rest of the family to arrive.  While Chief Wiggum initially tells him isn't interested in hearing Homer's life story initially, he becomes intrigued as Homer goes right into it, in the form of flashbacks (clips).  Homer is picked up and brought blindfolded to the Springfield Friar's Club where emcee Krusty the Klown and other friends and family roast Homer with their memories (more clips from past episodes).  Bart and Lisa start followed by Mr. Burns, Grampa Simpson & Agnes Skinner, Reverend Lovejoy & Ned Flanders (a la \"The Smothers Brothers\").  The proceedings are interrupted by Kodos and Kang, whom rest the entire fate of humanity upon one human being, Homer Simpson; they cite him as \"the fat selfish epitome of modern man\".  They probe him revealing more clips, which helps prove to them that humans are unfit to continue existing.  Lisa talks them into probing the innocent mind of a child.  The probing of Maggie's mind reveals to Kodos and Kang the most important thing of all for them; Earth is where there favorite celebrities live.  Kodos and Kang attend the \"People Choice Awards\" and the episode ends with a wacky little ditty celebrating more clips, but telling the viewers \"not to fear, they have stories for years.\"",

Bart finds a box of old videotapes.  He and Lisa start watching the tapes that are boring them, until Lisa finds a tape labeled \"BART SAD.\"  They put in the tape, which features an episode of Perfect Strangers and a commercial for a product that fights bad breath for babies.  The baby featured in the ad is none other than Bart, leading Lisa to realize the tape should have been titled \"Bart's Ad.\"  The baby in the ad is referred to as \"Baby Stinkbreath,\" which opens Bart up to name calling by his siblings.  Bart confronts his parents about the ad and Homer tells him he was going to tell him on his \"death bed.\"  They tell him he enjoyed making the commercials and he made a lot of money that Homer invested in a college trust fund.  Homer confesses that he used the money to buy back incriminating photos.  Bart demands the return of his money; Milhouse suggests that he get a lawyer.  He finds a lawyer and tells him he wants a divorce from his parents.  In court, Judge Harm renders her verdict, Bart is emancipated and half Homer's salary is to go to Bart.

      "Overview": "The kids are getting ready to go back to school.  On the first day, Principal Skinner holds an all school Spelling Bee, which Lisa easily wins, allowing her to go to the state spelling finals.  If she wins there, she can then go Spellympics.  Meanwhile, Homer has been trying Krustyburger's new \"Ribwich\" and enjoying it immensely.  At the state Spelling Bee Lisa wins, but is disappointed with Homer who tells her that \"very serious Daddy business\" is going to keep him away from her celebration.  Homer's daddy business consists of getting more Ribwiches.  He is disappointed when the Ribwich is no longer available.  Another Ribwich fan (and member of Ribwich Nation) informs Homer that the sandwich is going to be tested in other markets and he shows him the tour schedule.  For a moment, Homer considers joining them on their bus tour.  For her spelling efforts, Lisa is rewarded with a double-wide locker and she prepares for the Spellympics.  At the Spellympics, Lisa makes it to the finals.  Homer regrets that he won't be able to attend the finals, as he will be in San Francisco for the last day of the Ribwich.  George Plimpton talks to Lisa about getting her to throw the spelling bee so that a more popular competitor can help keep spelling a viable sport.  For throwing the bee, Lisa is offered a full scholarship to one of the seven sister's college of her choice.  Lisa wrestles with her conscience.  In San Francisco, Krusty stops by and tells the crowd they will no longer be making the Ribwich and he tosses them the last one.  Homer catches it, and offers are made to him for the last one.  He realizes that he's forsaken his daughter's big day for a sandwich and he trades it for a car, which he drives off to Lisa's big event.  At the Spellympics, Homer arrives just in time for Lisa to do her final word.  With her dad present, she blows the lid off of the rigged contest, but then misspells her word in the process.  She loses the contest, but back home in Springfield she is celebrated as \"the biggest winner this town has ever had.\"  They even have her likeness carved into the side of a mountain.",

      "Overview": "On St. Valentine's Day Marge is too tired in participating in the lovemaking that Homer was so looking forward to.  Dejected, Homer leaves the house and stumbles across a billboard for some extension courses.  When he is thrown out of the \"Strip for Your Wife\" class led by Dr. Hibbert, he stumbles into \"Successmanship 101\" class.  He gets the book for the class and with it he decides to change the direction of his life.  Homer goes into work with a new attitude, but when he presents his ideas for improvements to Mr. Burns, they are all rejected unread.  Later when Homer overhears that Mr. Burns actually has a canary named as the plant's legal owner.  With this information and some encouragement from his family Homer decides upon a plan.  With Bart's help, Homer releases the bird, which leaves the plant with no owner.  In rare sign of intelligence, Homer outwits Mr. Burns and is able to take over the vacancy left by the canary.  His first act in his new job is to fire Mr. Burns.  Now Homer is in charge of the power plant and besides learning about the \"door shutting thing\" he soon learns how difficult it is to be at the top.  He misses out on quality time with his family.  Mr. Burns returns for a visit and shows Homer the people he missed out on being with throughout his life, Mr. Burns then tries to kill Homer by drugging him and sealing him in a tomb.  He isn't fast enough as Homer recovers and easily escapes.  As a wrap up to his latest escapade Homer (and everyone) celebrate \"HOMER'S 305th EVERYTHING IS BACK TO NORMAL BBQ.\"",

      "Overview": "Principal Skinner introduces the students of Springfield Elementary to Declan Desmond, a documentary filmmaker.  Desmond is there to do a documentary on the school.  The children see an example of his work in the form of his documentary on Krusty Burger called \"Do You Want Lies With That?\"  He starts filming his documentary by focusing on school bullies.  Bart is being featured on camera for his role as a school bully, when he is humiliated by Nelson, the bigger bully.  Principal Skinner tries to divert Desmond's attention by focusing on Lisa.  Desmond easily spots the ruse and gives Lisa some advice that she should pick a path and follow it.  Bart searches for a way to become cool again.  When Nelson shows off a hood ornament he's stolen, Bart decides he needs to do the same, only bigger.  Lisa looks for career direction and finds inspiration at an astronomy exhibit.  Lisa gets Homer to buy her a telescope, only she soon discovers that light pollution from the town obscures her view.  Bart tries to regain his position, as Desmond watches.  He then finds Lisa is circulating a petition to reduce Springfield's light pollution.  It works and lights are put down, yes the stars have come out, but so have the criminals.  Nelson and company steal more hood ornaments.  Bart targets the ornate (Emmy award looking) hood ornament of Fat Tony's car.  Mayor Quimby caves into pressure from the townspeople and restores the lights of Springfield, to the point where it's daytime at night.  Bart and Milhouse were almost able to steal Fat Tony's hood ornament, when the lights go on.  24 hours of \"daylight\" begin to take their toll on the townspeople.  Bart is still scoping out Fat Tony's hood ornament, he only needs the cover of darkness to pull of his crime.  Since he and Lisa want the same thing, they team up to get Homer to go into power plant and overload the city's lights.  Springfield is back in the dark when the townspeople come to protest the lack of lights.  Fortunately for Bart and Lisa a meteor shower begins and that distracts everyone.  In the end, Declan Desmond's documentary \"American Boneheads: A Day in the Life of Springfield Elementary\" is shown.",

      "Overview": "It's Christmastime and the family is out caroling.  When they carol outside of a lawyer's house, he informs them they can't sing the song they're singing without paying a royalty.  This inspires Homer to decide to write his own Christmas carol, but when Flanders tries to help and begins annoying him, Homer is instead inspired to write an anti-Flanders song.  Homer plays his new song at Moe's where a passing David Byrne overhears it and offers to produce and record it.  The song \"Everybody Hates Ned Flanders\" becomes a national hit and is even covered by William Shatner.  To get away from the over-exposure of the hit song, the family decides to take a vacation to a dude ranch.  At the Lazy I ranch, Comic Book Guy looks for an Internet connection and Lisa is annoyed to find out that the ranch was built on cruelty to animals and oppression of indigenous people.  Lisa wants to go home, until sometime later when she meets Luke Stetson, a junior wrangler who shares her views.  Homer and Bart meet some indigenous people who tell them that they've lost their land to a natural beaver dam.  Homer gets them to agree to build a fair casino, if he helps them get back their land.  Lisa overhears that Luke already has a girlfriend named Clara and her heart is broken.  Lisa encounters Clara and gives her false directions to the dance.  Homer and Bart manage to outsmart the beavers and indigenous people are able to reclaim their land.  At the dance, Lisa finds out that Clara, her competition is actually Luke's sister.  Lisa gets Bart to help her find Clara, who they rescue with the help of some beavers.  The family is set to return to Springfield, when they hear a new David Byrne produced song on the radio \"The Moe Szyslak Connection\" and decide they can afford another week at the ranch.",

      "Overview": "Bart's tree house is destroyed and the Amish are called in to rebuild it.  Because the Amish are master electricians, Bart's new tree house catches fire at its grand opening.  Everyone makes it to safety, with the exception of Homer, who is trapped.  He looks to the family dog for help, but Santa's Little Helper (SLH) is a coward and only saves himself.  It's up to Snowball II to save Homer's life.  Snowball II is made a hero in Homer's eyes and SLH is thrown out of the house.  The dog park is turned into a cat park and renamed for Snowball II.  SLH doesn't look very good in the eyes of his fellow dogs either.  Kent Brockman asks Homer about his cat and any other pets he may have and Homer makes the bold statement that \"I have no dog.\"  Bart and Lisa look to help SLH regain his status as family dog.  Their efforts fail.  A passing photographer spots SLH drinking beer from a can that he is balancing on his nose.  The photo appears in the paper and the owner of Duff Brewery decides its time to replace Duffman with a dog.  The family signs a contract for the brewery's new spokesdog \"Suds McDuff.\"  The new campaign is a hit.  The family stands to make lots of money, until SLH's original owner from the dog track comes to lay claim to his dog.  He uses a tape of Homer's own words against him as proof of his continued ownership of the dog.  SLH is being exploited by his original owner.  The family comes up with a plan to get their dog back.  They find the actor who played Duffman (Barry Duffman) and plan to have him rescue a drowning Homer, when it becomes obvious to the crown that \"Suds McDuff\" is a cowardly dog.  The plan doesn't work, when Duffman turns out to be as cowardly as his replacement.  The shark that tried to attack Homer becomes \"wasted\" on the Duff beer that came out of the keg that Homer was floating on.  As a result, the shark becomes the company's new mascot.  With his gravy train at an end, SLH's original owner returns the dog back to the family.",

Lisa spots penguins flying and after Bart has shown off his \"flawless pearls,\" which results in him being taken the hospital, where a lack of insurance card keeps him prisoner.  Homer has the insurance card, but is nowhere to be found.  As a solution, Homer gets a mobile phone and a few extra unnecessary accessories, which only leads to him not paying attention to where he is driving.

      "Overview": "When Marge sees Bart and Milhouse incited to violence after watching an episode of South Park, she tries to turn them onto some good television on the PAX television network.  They run out of the room and find themselves outside and bored.  After tying a thread to a housefly, that lands itself inside of the Flanders home, Bart and Milhouse find themselves inside the home, unsupervised.  They cause some damage and find Ned's collection of Beatles memorabilia.  They drink from cans of a 40-year-old novelty beverage and start to get sick.  Ned and the boys return to their home to find the house \"slightly askew,\" and they flee to their panic room and call the police.  The police arrive and capture the boys and Bart pleads that his parents not be called.  The parents are called and as part of Bart's punishment he is sentenced to spending all his time under the supervision of a parent.  He is also no longer allowed to play with Milhouse, who Marge believes incites Bart into his bad behavior.  Bart joins the \"Pre-Teen Braves\" and Homer becomes the tribe leader.  When Homer fails in his leadership skills, Marge takes over.  Marge takes the boys on a nature walk and they meet a Native American who shows them a field that is in need of restoration.  The \"Pre-Teen Braves\" return to the field to begin their clean-up effort, only to discover that the \"Calvary Kids\" that Milhouse and his father are a members of have already done the job.  The two groups go to war and try to outdo each other in doing good.  When the opportunity to become batboys at an Isotopes game is on the line, the two sides redouble their efforts for their candy sales.  The \"Pre-Teen Braves\" lace the \"Calvary Kids\" candy bars with laxatives and believe they are going to win.  Only the senior citizens, in a need of relief from constipation, buy the \"Calvary Kids\" a win.  At the Isotopes game, the \"Calvary Kids\" are delayed from arriving and the \"Pre-Teen Braves\" take their place singing their version of the national anthem.  The crowd becomes angered by the version of the anthem that is being sung and when the real \"Calvary Kids\" arrive, a fight breaks out between everyone in the crowd.  When the image of Marge crying is shown on the Jumbotron, the fighting ends and the sweet soothing hymn of the national anthem of Canada is sung by all present.  In the end, Bart and Milhouse sum it up by saying that they've learned that: \"War is not the answer--except to all of America's problems.\"",

      "Overview": "The family goes to the Springfield Botanical Gardens, where they and the other residents are there to see the blossoming of the Sumatran Century Flower.  When his bar is empty, Moe finds out that is where all his customers have gone and he goes to join them.  With a capacity crowd plus one on hand, Chief Wiggum has to send someone away and he selects Moe.  As a result, Moe is one of the only ones to not be driven out of town by the obnoxious and somewhat lethal (to other plant life) smell of the Sumatran Century Flower when it finally does bloom.  The mass exodus from Springfield results in a huge traffic jam on the Springfield Bridge.  When traffic begins to move, Homer hits the accelerator, only to have to immediately slam on the brakes, because traffic didn't move that far.  The quick stop to family car and the faulty seat restraint that was holding Maggie in the backseat causes her to be launch through the sunroof and over the side of the bridge.  She lands in the arms of Moe, who was perched on the side of the bridge ready to commit suicide.  Moe becomes a hero.  Moe stops by to see Maggie and winds up watching her when Marge needs to care of Grampa, who's out on the street acting crazier than normal.  Moe becomes Maggie's fulltime babysitter.  Moe entertains Maggie by telling her a story; of course it's \"The Godfather\" saga.  Late in the evening after Maggie's birthday party, where Homer began to learn that Maggie prefers Moe over him, Marge and Homer hear Maggie crying.  They go to her room only to find Moe already there calming her down.  They forbid him to ever see her again.  The next day, Moe is lonely and missing Maggie.  That night, outside her window, Maggie overhears Fat Tony and his boys plan to take out the Castellaneta family.  She crawls out her window and begins pursuing them.  Marge discovers Maggie is gone and they immediately suspect Moe.  When Moe doesn't have her and he finds out she is missing, he offers to help.  Clues outside Maggie's window reveal that the mob was gathered outside of her window and Moe suggests that they might find her in little Italy.  At a restaurant in Little Italy Maggie finds she is in the middle of an \"Italian-American Mexican standoff.\"  Moe volunteers to go in and rescue her.  He draws the mobster's attention to Maggie which causes them to all go soft.  Moe returns Maggie to Homer and Marge and prepares to leave; only Maggie doesn't want him to go.  Homer and Marge agree that Moe can have the occasional play date with Maggie, provided he brings along his ham to accompany Homer.",

      "Overview": "Mr. Burns uses his ATM card and gets a $1000 bill.  It hits him in the chest and then blows away, right across town and into the Simpson living room window, where Bart gets a hold of it.  His parents (well Marge anyway) make him put up a notice so that the owner might have a chance to claim the bill.  When no one can identify the bill, Bart wonders what he can do with his new windfall.  He realizes that he can make money showing off his bill, so he opens up the \"Museum of Modern Bart\" in his tree house.  Mr. Burns makes his claim for the bill, but all is not lost.  Bart has made over $3000 in admissions to his museum.  To make use of the money the family decides to go to England, where Abe recalls having a memorable night with a beautiful English girl named Edwina.  In merry ole England, the Simpsons meet Prime Minister Tony Blair.  Abe tries to find Edwina, meanwhile the rest of the family tours London.  Everything is going fine until Homer slams his rental Mini into the back of the Queen's horse drawn carriage.  Homer is put on trial, makes an ass out of himself in court and is thrown into the Tower of London.  Lisa finds a way for Homer to escape his tower cell, a secret tunnel once used by Sir Walter Raleigh.  Unfortunately the tunnel leads to the Queen's bedroom.  Homer's pathetic plea with the Queen works and the family is allowed to leave the country, provided they take Madonna with them.  Before boarding the plane, Edwina calls out to Abe, and introduces him to her daughter of 58 years, Abbie, a woman who looks like Homer in drag.  Abe runs on board the plane as fast as he can.",

While riding the modified bike, they are hassled by older boys with \"big boy\" bikes.  It makes Bart wish for a ten-speed bike.  To get a new bike Bart sacrifices his old bike right in front of Dr. Hibbert's Mercedes.  As Dr. Hibbert leaves his Mercedes then runs over Snowball II and Lisa is devastated.  Bart and Homer get Bart a new bike, but it needs to be assembled and Homer tries to do his best.  The bike falls apart when Bart tries to show it off to the older boys.  Later Bart and Homer are watching \"Robot Rumble\" and the father and son teams inspire Homer to try building a robot for them to enter in competition but Bart leads Homer to believe that Bart thinks he is an oaf.  Marge and Lisa look for a new cat and Lisa finds a new one that she calls Snowball III.  Homer tries to build a robot, but his result is a failure.  Homer looks to his father for inspiration and becomes a robot instead of building one.  Bart wakes to find Homer's robot in his room, which is actually Homer inside of large metal shell powered by a tricycle.  Lisa finds that Snowball III has drowned in the fish tank.  Bart competes on \"Robot Rumble,\" with the robot he's called \"Chief Knock-A-Homer,\" but Homer is nowhere to be found.  Homer, hidden inside the robot, manages to win his first match, but only after he receives numerous cuts and bruises.  Lisa gets (and quickly loses) a new cat named Coltrane.  Chief Knock-A-Homer quickly works his way into the finals, but Bart is sorry that his father hasn't been able to see any of the Chief's victories.  The Chief's final match is scheduled to be against Professor Frink and his son's deadly looking robot.  Lisa, depressed about her propensity to kill cats, is surprised when a crazy lady leaves her with a new cat.  Lisa sees that new cat looks kill proof, and decides to call it Snowball II and forgot the whole dead cat thing ever happened.  After the first round of the finals Bart discovers the secret inside of Chief Knock-A-Homer and thinks his dad is even cooler for doing that.  The match is stopped in the second round when Homer's presence in the robot is revealed to everyone.  The law of robotics saves Homer's life and the Frink robot goes out its way to make Homer comfortable.  Nature's greatest killing machine is declared the winner.",

      "Overview": "On a school field trip to the Museum of Television and TV Milhouse shows that he has developed a new attitude where he just doesn't care.  Meanwhile Mr. Burns has moved Homer, Lenny and Carl to an offsite location (Moe's) so that they don't ruin a visit by the plant's board of directors.  Apu and Manjula stop by celebrating their anniversary, making Homer realize he hasn't gotten anything for his anniversary with Marge.  He gets extremely drunk and finds himself ‘dancing' on the street where people, thinking he is homeless, start giving him money.  Milhouse reveals the secret to his new attitude is the fact that he and his mother are moving to Capitol City, where they are going to get a fresh start.  Both Bart and Kirk Van Houten are going to have to learn to get along without Milhouse being around.  Bart tries to adapt to a world without Milhouse, especially after a visit to Milhouse in Capitol City makes him realize that things will never be the same.  In the meantime, Homer has begun begging as a second job when he realizes he can make good money that allows him to buy Marge an expensive anniversary gift.  With Milhouse out of his life, Bart finds himself bonding with his sister and she is enjoying the new relationship with her brother; a relationship that gets tested when Kirk gets \"pity custody\" of Milhouse and Marge is enlightened by the homeless on Homer's second source of income.",

      "Overview": "Lisa is going to read a poem at the town's celebration of their natural landmark \"Geezer Rock,\" but Homer who believes he is doing the right thing removes a bush from the landmark that causes it to fall apart.  Mr. Burns is caught in the landslide and Smithers fears he is lost.  Lisa is disappointed that no one got to hear her poem and Marge suggests that she get it published.  To Smithers' delight, Mr. Burns has survived the landslide by slithering his way out however; he is annoyed to find out that no one missed him when they thought he was lost.  He decides to buy every media outlet in town.  Lisa distributes the first issue of her own newspaper the \"The Red Dress Press,\" which is a success.  Now she has to get out a second issue and she enlists the help of her fellow children.  Meanwhile, Mr. Burns has taken control of all the media outlets in Springfield, except one, her newspaper.  Mr. Burns tries to seduce Lisa into selling out but she won't give up.  Now Mr. Burns starts to play hardball, he cuts the power to the Simpson home.  Principal Skinner offers Lisa the use of an old mimeograph machine, which gets her latest issue out.

Lisa is ready to give up and Homer realizing what he's done responds by printing a newspaper of his own.  Homer's paper inspires others to think to begin to think for themselves and soon everyone is printing their own newspaper.",

      "Overview": "We open with an episode of \"Keepin' It Kodos\" with Kang.  In this episode, Kang and Kodos have the Simpson family for dinner with their boss.  The meal is a success as Kang gets a hyper-galactic promotion. \n\na). \"The Ned Zone\"\n\nHomer knocks Ned unconscious with his bowling ball, when he recovers he discovers that he was really dying of a brain tumour & the bowling ball lodged it out (which give him premonitions of doom).  He tells Homer about his new power and Homer wants to know his future.  Ned sees Homer being shot in the back, and the shooter is he.  Ned keeps this information to himself and manages to not shoot Homer.  He then finds out that Homer is going to cause the destruction of all of Springfield by destroying the plant's nuclear reactor.  Ned goes to the power plant to try to prevent the catastrophe. Unfortunately, he had to kill Homer to save everyone (but even through that, Homer accidently fell onto the nuclear reactor button still consious from the bullet & killed everyone in the end). At least, everyone is in a better place. \n\nb). \"Four Beheadings and a Funeral\"\n\nThe \"Mutton Chop Murderer\" has taken another victim, and Eliza Simpson and her sidekick Dr. Bartley join with Inspector Wiggum of Scotland Yard to find the killer.  The dagger used is the latest crime is found to be one of a set, and they find that the set was owned by C. Ebenezer Burns.  They go to the opium den and find that Burns had sold the daggers to a fat man (Homer) to get money for opium.  The fat man is caught and sentenced to death, but when Eliza and Dr. Bartley find yet another body, Eliza knows the fat man is innocent and finds an important clue to the real killer's identity on the latest murder weapon.\n\nc). \"In the Belly of the Boss\"\n\nAt the \"New Invention Expo\" Maggie gets inside of a new vitamin pill that is going to be reduced by Prof. Frink's new shrink ray.  The pill is swallowed by Mr. Burns.  The other Simpson family members become bionauts inside a submarine that is miniaturized and sent inside of Mr. Burn's body.  Maggie is found, but there is not enough power to get everyone and the submarine out of the body, someone must stay behind, & that person is (drumroll) Homer (again). Everyone else makes it out & Frink announces that there is still a chance to save Homer. Unfortunately, he returns to normal size inside the skin of Mr. Burn's.\n\nThen, everyone from all three segments of the episode start dancing.",

      "Overview": "The house next door is for sale and Marge and Homer go inside to check it out; Marge falls in love with the kitchen.  Back at home Marge asks Homer for a new kitchen.  Rather than hire someone, Homer decides to do the renovation himself.  While demolishing the kitchen, Homer unleashes his old collection of Playdude magazines.  He tells Marge he keeps them for the articles; she obliges him by cutting up the magazines, keeping only the articles.  Now that they are useless, Homer throws them away, only to have them found by Bart and Milhouse.  Using these 1970's era magazines as a model, Bart decides to renovate the Treehouse.  After Homer has made a mess of the kitchen remodeling, Marge is finally able to hire a contractor, who completes the job \"on-time\" two years later for $100,000.  Marge's first new dish out of her kitchen gets rave reviews and she decides to enter the Ovenfresh Bakeoff with her Dessert Dogs.  At the bakeoff Marge encounters stiff and ruthless competition, so ruthless that Marge resorts to cheating to get even, much to Lisa's dismay.  Chief Wiggum and other concerned parents talk with Homer about Bart's spreading the Playdude philosophy to the other children.  Homer has a talk with Bart about the facts of life, which a horrified Bart quickly spreads to the other children.  Meantime, in the finals for the bakeoff against Brandine, Marge admits to her foul play and Lisa's faith in her mother is restored.",

Homer performs a wild crowd-pleasing dance at a local carnival, after beating Bart's performance in a game.  Ned Flanders has captured the performance on videotape and Comic Book Guy (Jeff Albertson) puts it up on the Internet.  The video gets worldwide attention, much to Homer's embarrassment but his tune changes when a football player wants to buy the rights to use his dance as his own end zone celebration.  Homer turns the opportunity into a new lucrative occupation, which prospers as other athletes come to learn from him.  Meanwhile Ned looks to create his own wholesome entertainment by creating his own versions of bible stories, which get the backing of Mr. Burns.  Marge doesn't like his approach, which eliminates the good aspects of the stories, and only concentrates on the violence.  She threatens a boycott, which gets Burns to remove his financial backing, leaving Ned with no creative outlet.  The commissioner of football (and all the owners) want to talk to Homer, his teaching of crazy antics to their players have increased their ratings.  They want him to choreograph the Superbowl half-time show.  Homer struggles for a show idea and on the night before the big show he still doesn't have one.  Homer looks for inspiration at the church, but instead finds Flanders, who is looking for an outlet for his ideas.  Together they bring the story of Noah to the half-time show, but everyone boos as no one wanted to see such a \"blatant display of religion and decency.\"",

Marge wants Homer to fix the roof by himself.  Homer runs into Ray at the Builder's Barn and Ray promises to stop by later and help him with the roof.  Homer waits for him, but Marge is skeptical that Ray even exists when Ray never shows up.  Marge has Homer placed in the mental ward of the hospital and she and no one else can confirm that Ray really exists.  Dr. Hibbert recommends and gives Homer electro-shock therapy.  Six weeks later Homer's treatments are over and to everyone's surprise Ray turns up at the hospital to celebrate Homer's release.

      "Overview": "Bart and Lisa want to start getting their hair cut at the mall.  They go to the mall with Homer and while getting their haircut they get into a fight, which results in them each getting really bad haircuts.  Out in the mall they are spotted by fellow school students who have cameras in hand.  They find Homer and go on the run; they sneak into the back entrance of a movie theater and see the film \"Left Below,\" which is a movie about the apocalypse.  The images in the movie are disturbing to Homer, who fears the worst.  Marge assures him that there needs to be some ominous signs before the rapture will come.  When Homer is out driving, he sees what he believes to be the signs.  Homer gathers some books on the subject and he calculates that the \"rapture is nigh\" at 3:15 PM on May 18th, seven days from now.  He starts to spread the word and tells everyone on television a passage from Revelations 6:13 that says before the rapture \"the stars will fall to Earth.\"  At the Springfield Stadium, there is a celebrity filled blimp accident that causes the stars on board to fall to the Earth and Homer gains instant credibility.  He gets a bus full of people to join him at Springfield Mesa.  When the appointed time comes and goes, Homer loses credibility and everyone return back to their normal lives.  Homer later realizes that he made a mistake in his calculation and the new time is only 30 minutes away.  When no one in his family will join him Homer goes to the Mesa on his own.  The rapture comes and Homer goes to heaven, but despite all that heaven has to offer, Homer needs his family.  He gets an audience with God, but when God won't grant his request to have his family join him; Homer begins raising hell in heaven.  To put a stop to it, God agrees to turn back time and put off the rapture.",

      "Overview": "After being humiliated by Mrs. Krabappel's class, Mr. Burns finally decides to buy a new car, so he orders a Lamborgotti Fasterossa.  He sends Homer and his family to the factory in Italy to pick the car up.  The family takes a tour of Italy in the new car, but an accident with the car and a cheese truck has the family pushing the car into the town of Salsiccia.  They find out that only one person in the town speaks English and it happens to be their mayor.  The family goes to meet the mayor and they are surprised to see that it is Sideshow Bob, and he is equally surprised to see them.  Sideshow Bob tells them how he came to Italy, become mayor and started a family with his wife (Francesca) and son (Gino).  He hopes that the Simpsons will keep the secret of his criminal past, but Lisa’s first exposure to drinking wine leads to loose lips, which sinks his ship.  Sideshow Bob, being no longer welcome in his new home, swears a vendetta on the Simpson family.  The Simpsons go on the run from Sideshow Bob, who is joined by his wife and son as the vendetta affects their entire family.  In Rome, the family discovers that Krusty is preparing to perform the lead in “I Pagliacci.”  The Simpsons hide as extras within the show, but Krusty gets tossed off-stage only to be replaced by Sideshow Bob, whose family has the Simpsons surrounded.  Krusty and his limo save the day, while Sideshow Bob and his family adjust to their unresolved vendetta.",

      "Overview": "When Reverend Lovejoy and Ned Flanders are unable to deliver the Christmas sermon, Homer steps in and tells the story of the birth of the baby Jesus (Bart), King Harod’s (Mr. Burns’) attempt to have the baby killed and the creation of the first Christmas tree.\n\nGrandpa relates to Bart and Lisa the story of how in the Navy he and his older brother Cyrus were fighting in the Pacific in World War II.  During a battle Cyrus’s plane is lost and Abe and Mr. Burns (his co-pilot) crash land their own plane.  At Christmastime while awaiting rescue, Burns, anxious to shoot at something, shoots down Santa Claus.  Abe and Burns help Santa to rebuild his sleigh (only for Burns to later steal.)  After Abe gets it back, Santa promises to come back for a follow-up rescue, but never does.  After Abe has finished relating the story to the kids, Santa makes his overdue appearance and takes Abe to Tahiti to be reunited with his brother.\n\nThe kids at Springfield Elementary perform “Perhaps the worst version ever” rendition of “The Nutcracker” ballet according to Superintendent Chalmers.  When it is revealed that you don’t have to pay for the music rights it leads to a montage of citizens of Springfield going about their usual Christmas activities to the more familiar pieces of music from “The Nutcracker,” including a sequence where Moe tries to kill himself, and Homer (forgetting as usual) tries to get Marge her present at the last minute.",
